I'm building the site in Middleman but hosting it on firebase. It's dumb, and there's probably a way better way to handle this.

You can build the site with `bundle exec middleman build`

Once you [install fireabse](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase) you can run the server with `firebase serve`
